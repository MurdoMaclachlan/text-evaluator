=FEATURE 1.1==
>>Add a system that allows users to save personal values to an account they create. This will require an encryption system to hide 
their password, and a folder to contain each users' unique text files.

>This will require the addition of a "user" folder. Each user that creates a new account will receive their own user folder (e.g., 
user "xXEdgeLord200Xx" will get the directory "user/xxedgelord200xx").
>This will require the following code:
    os.mkdir(dirName)
        print("Account ",dirName," created.") 
    except FileExistsError:
        print("The username ",dirName,"is already taken. Please choose another.")

>Encryption will be required for the storage of sensitive user data (e.g., passwords).
>This will require the following code:
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
    encryptedText = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"message")
>Decryption will require the following code:
    plainText = cipher_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)

>Check to see whether terms of service are legally required despite not being an organisation. UK law is strange.

>This system will require a complete rework of the UI.

>The users must be capable of creating their accounts, as well as deleting them. Upon the start of the deletion process, a user 
must re-enter their login details. They will then be asked to confirm that they wish to delete their account. Account deletion is 
permenant.
>The following code will be implemented to delete users' accounts.
    os.remove()
    os.rmdir()
